# Tic-Tac-Toe
## A desktop multiplayer game of Tic-Tac-Toe created using Java and InteliJ IDE. UI created using Swift.

### The game is created to show knowledge and level of skill working with 2D arrays (although for the grid I've used built-in functions), loops, methods, classes, exception handling, a bit of OOP and Swift.
### In order to launch it, you will need to import the files, as the resulting .bat file triggers antivirus software.
# Planned improvements:
### 1. Scoreboard
### 2. Game Menu
### 3. Quit/Continue prompts
