# Tic-Tac-Toe
## A desktop multiplayer game of Tic-Tac-Toe created using Java and JFrame.

### The game is created to show knowledge and level of skill working with 2D arrays (although for the grid I've used built-in functions), loops, methods, classes, exception handling, a bit of OOP and Swift.
# How to run
### In order to launch it, you will need to import the files, as the resulting .bat file triggers antivirus software.
# Additional information
### When the game launches the starting player is selected randomly, and the current player is represented in the frame above the grid.
### The player selects the tiles with the mouse. Once a winning combination is achieved, the winner is displayed, and the winning path is highlighted.
# Planned improvements:
### 1. Scoreboard
### 2. Game Menu
### 3. Quit/Continue prompts
